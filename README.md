# Hospital Readmission Projects 
A data analytics project focused on understanding the drivers behind rising hospital readmission rates and providing insights to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance care quality.

## Background

As a data analyst in the administration department at Novartis Hospital, your role is to support patient-care improvements through data-driven decision-making. Recently, the hospital has experienced a sharp increase in patient readmissions, raising concerns about care quality, patient outcomes, and regulatory compliance.

Your task is to analyze hospital admissions and patient records to identify patterns, risk factors, and operational gaps that contribute to high readmission rates.
